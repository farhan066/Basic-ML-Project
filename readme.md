# Color Guess AI with Brain JS

This is a basic machine learning project that generates a random background color and changes the text color between white and black to create a contrast with the background.

To train the model, I have provided a link to a training page where you can easily train the model visually and print the training data. Instructions on how to use the training page will be provided, and the process is straightforward.

## Tools Used:
- Html & Css
- Javascript
- Brain JS
